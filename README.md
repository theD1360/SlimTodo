Just a little todo app REST API built on slim3 and datamapper architectures 

clone repository then run


```
$ cd Sample\app

$ cp .env.example .env
$ vim .env #you need to edit this file with your connection variables

$ composer install

```

This sample doesn't have a migration manager installed so you will need to
run the sql contained in `Sample/app/migrations` to get your db installed

once everything is ready you can either add it the `Sample\app\public` directory to 
your apache sites or you can run 


```
cd public

php -S localhost:8080

```
